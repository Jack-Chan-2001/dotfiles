# dotfiles
Hi! I'm Jack. It's my dotfiles.


## Installation

if you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first review the code. Don't blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails.🍭

**.vimrc**

```shell
sudo echo "source /etc/vim/.vimrc" >> /etc/vim/vimrc
sudo cp ./.vimrc /etc/vim/
source /etc/vim/vimrc
```
